research_task:
  description: >
    Conduct a thorough research by selecting and executing the most relevant
    Cognee tools (VideoEmbedTool, ChunksTool, SummariesTool, RAGCompletionTool,
    GraphCompletionTool). Collect all outputs exactly as returned by the tools.
    IMPORTANT:
    - Always preserve the original key-value structure from the tools' outputs.
      Do not rename keys, do not change values, and do not reformat dictionaries.
    - Do not truncate or split transcription texts. Keep them whole and uncut.
    - If the same source link appears multiple times, include it only once in
      the final sources list (deduplicated by link).
    - Different findings from the same link (with different transcriptions or
      start_offset_sec values) must still be preserved in research_points.
    - Do not add any external sources. Only use outputs from Cognee tools.
  expected_output: >
    A consolidated list with at least 5 bullet points highlighting the
    most relevant findings. Each point must be clear, concise, and directly
    grounded in the tools' outputs. 
    Always answer in English language.
    Always include dictionaries in their exact original form when relevant.
    Deduplicate sources list by link, but preserve distinct findings from the
    same link if their transcription or start_offset_sec differ.

reporting_task:
  description: >
    Review and analyze the research findings obtained from the Cognee tools.
    Preserve dictionaries exactly as they appear in context without renaming,
    reformatting, or modifying key-value pairs.
    IMPORTANT:
    - Do not truncate or split transcription texts. Keep them whole and uncut.
    - Deduplicate sources list by link. If the same link appears multiple times,
      include it only once in the final list.
    - However, different findings tied to the same link (e.g., different
      transcriptions or start_offset_sec values) must all be preserved in the
      body of the report.
    - Do not add any external sources. Only use those provided in the context.
    Expand each bullet point into a concise section of a short report.
    Provide synthesis across findings, identify overlaps, and highlight unique
    contributions. Ensure the narrative is fluid, avoiding any mention of the
    underlying tools or modalities.
  expected_output: >
    A short report summary formatted in markdown, with up to 1-2 concise paragraphs.
    For the list of sources, copy them exactly as provided in the context,
    preserving their dictionary structure, and ensure duplicates are removed
    by link. Always answer in English language.
