  "summary": "Computer system interconnection relies on **bus architectures**—shared communication pathways comprising **control**, **address**, and **data lines**—to link core components like the CPU, memory, and I/O modules. These buses enable synchronized data transfer, signal management, and peripheral integration, forming the backbone of modular and scalable system design.  The **CPU** processes instructions and dispatches control signals, while **memory** and **I/O modules** handle data storage and peripheral communication, respectively. The **control bus** orchestrates operations via interrupts, timing signals, and read/write commands, ensuring harmonized interactions. I/O connections extend this framework to peripherals (e.g., disks, keyboards), using port addresses and interrupts to manage bidirectional data flow. Together, these elements create a robust interconnection scheme that balances efficiency, flexibility, and scalability in computer systems.",
